# Foodship
Foodship brings the concept of connecting friends over food to life, featuring a compelling landing page, sections that showcase its mission and community, and interactive features like user-friendly group formation and meetup scheduling. It also includes information on how Foodship works, its core values, and how to join the community.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.IO, Multer, Cloudinary, Agenda.js, and the Hugging Face API  

I developed Foodship's platform with a focus on simplicity and community-building. The responsive design ensures that users can access the site seamlessly across devices, with Bootstrap managing styles for a clean, modern look. JavaScript and backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB were employed to create interactive features, such as group creation and event scheduling. I used Socket.io to handle real-time messaging and related real-time data updates.

## Optimizations

In the future optimization phase, I will be focused on improving the website's performance and user experience. This includes optimizing images, implementing lazy loading for assets, and refining the codebase for faster loading times.

## Lessons Learned:

Building foodship taught me valuable lessons in integrating front-end design with back-end functionality. I gained experience in creating user-friendly interfaces while managing dynamic features, such as forming groups and scheduling meetups. This project enhanced my understanding of building a full-stack application that balances performance with interactivity, ensuring the platform is both functional and intuitive for users.
