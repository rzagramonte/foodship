## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, Passport, and MongoDB

I developed foodship's platform with a focus on simplicity and community-building. The responsive design ensures that users can access the site seamlessly across devices, with bootstrap managing styles for a clean, modern look. JavaScript and backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB were employed to create interactive features, such as group creation and event scheduling.

## Optimizations

In the future optimization phase, I will be focused on improving the website's performance and user experience. This includes optimizing images, implementing lazy loading for assets, and refining the codebase for faster loading times.

## Lessons Learned:

Building foodship taught me valuable lessons in integrating front-end design with back-end functionality. I gained experience in creating user-friendly interfaces while managing dynamic features, such as forming groups and scheduling meetups. This project enhanced my understanding of building a full-stack application that balances performance with interactivity, ensuring the platform is both functional and intuitive for users.
